# Microservices Repository

Welcome to the Microservices Repository! This repository hosts a collection of microservices that can be deployed individually in a Docker-based VPS or on serverless platforms.

## About

This repository contains a collection of microservices designed to provide modular functionality for various applications. Each microservice is self-contained and can be deployed independently, allowing for scalability and flexibility in architecture.

## Deployment Options

### Docker-based VPS

The microservices in this repository can be deployed to a Docker-based Virtual Private Server (VPS) environment. Each microservice is packaged with a Dockerfile and can be built into Docker images for deployment. Docker Compose or Kubernetes can be used for orchestration and management of multiple microservices.

### Serverless Platforms

Alternatively, the microservices can be deployed to serverless platforms such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions. Serverless architectures offer scalability and cost-effectiveness by automatically scaling resources based on demand and charging only for actual usage.

## Included Microservice

### [Express EJS Email Sender](./emailer)

The **Express EJS Email Sender** microservice is included in this repository. It is an Express application that uses EJS templates to send emails with Nodemailer. This microservice supports CORS, rate limiting, and reads configuration from environment variables. It can be deployed individually or as part of a larger application.

## Getting Started

To deploy any of the microservices included in this repository, refer to the respective README file in each microservice's directory for detailed instructions on deployment, configuration, and usage.
